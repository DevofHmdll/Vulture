# 1. Rationale for Funding

Due to technical limitations and restricted access to professional development infrastructure, the project has prioritized an intensive research phase over active coding. Secured funding will serve as a catalyst for practical development.
Financial support will guarantee access to essential development and laboratory infrastructure. Furthermore, partnering with NLnet aligns the project with an organization renowned for fostering innovative, accessible, and open-source technologies.
# 1.1 Funding Requirements
The total funding requested is €12,000. These funds are necessary to acquire local development hardware, access advanced technical education, secure professional mentorship, and incentivize expert contributors.

# 2. Budget Allocation
The following table details the distribution of the requested €12,000

| Expense Category | Allocated Amount (€) | Remaining Balance (€) |
|---|---|---|
| Primary Development Workstation | 4,500 | 7,500 |
| Network Infrastructure | 1,200 | 6,300 |
| Laboratory Hardware | 1,200 | 5,100 |
| Data Resilience & Storage | 800 | 4,300 |
| Educational Programs, Literature & Mentorship | 800 | 3,500 |
| Maintenance & Operations | 600 | 2,900 |
| Contingency Fund | 2,000 | 900 |
| Miscellaneous Costs | 900 | 0 |
# 3. Timeline and Milestones (Roadmap)

The development of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is projected for a 6–12 month window, focusing on establishing the telemetry backbone and core architecture.
 * Months 1–4: Establish telemetry foundations and develop rule-based modules for anomaly pattern detection.
 * Months 4–6: Define inter-model communication using Python-based simulations; validate performance within virtualized environments.
 * Months 6–9: Refine telemetry classification and data integration. Optimize system performance to minimize latency and computational overhead.
 * Months 9–12: Training and implementation of Machine Learning (ML) models; integrate monitoring for local Large Language Model (LLM) logs.
 * Beyond 12 Months: Delivery of a functional, virtualized prototype with high-performance metrics in detection, correlation, and automated reporting.

# 4. FOSS Focus and Philosophy

Project Vulture is built upon the principles of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) to ensure:
 * Democratization: Providing high-level defensive software without the barrier of proprietary licensing fees.
 * Transparency: Ensuring privacy and "white-box" visibility for critical environments.
 * Ecosystem Integration: Complementing the Linux-based FOSS stack.
 * Ethical AI: Implementing AI in defensive security through an ethical, auditable framework.
 * Autonomy: Reducing reliance on closed-source corporate ecosystems and vendor lock-in.
Summary: Open-source principles are the cornerstone of Project Vulture and will guide every stage of its development.
