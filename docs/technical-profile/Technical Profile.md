Technical Profile — Ernesto M. Alfonso Campos



# I. General Information

My name is Ernesto Miguel Alfonso Campos, a young pre-university researcher based in Cuba. My primary focus is the development of the Vulture system, alongside my academic commitments and studies. This document serves as a provisional technical profile, outlining my background, motivations, and current approach as the lead developer of the project.

# II. Background
I am an independent researcher specializing in local threat detection within Linux infrastructure. My work focuses on designing and implementing detection mechanisms that provide transparent, auditable, and contextualized explanations for system events.
Rather than developing monolithic or "black-box" systems, I prioritize architectures where every alert and decision is logged to ensure human-interpretability—allowing users to understand the logic behind every system action.
Relevant Technical Experience
Architectural Design: Development of a hierarchical detection architecture with specialized operational layers.
Linux Environments: Practical experience in Linux systems, including terminal-centric workflows and internal system analysis tools.
Professional Training: Completion of IBM SkillsBuild courses specializing in AI and Cybersecurity.
Documentation Standards: Implementation of documentation as a "first-class artifact," covering technical architecture, assumptions, and ethical frameworks.

# III. Evidence of Capability

The following documents demonstrate my technical competency and design rationale (note: documents currently in development will be appended upon completion):
[[Architecture]]: Detailed documentation of the system's structural design.
[[Ethics]]: Documentation regarding the project's ethical framework and principles.
[[Assumptions]]: Explicit documentation of the assumptions made regarding system development and future implementation.
These materials substantiate concrete design decisions, technical trade-offs, and system constraints rather than abstract concepts.
