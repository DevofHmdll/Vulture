# 1. Scope of this Document

This document defines the ethical principles, responsibility assumptions, and usage constraints for the Vulture research project.

Vulture is a pre‑development initiative aimed at defensive anomaly detection and the generation of interpretable explanations in Linux environments. Consequently, this document does not establish legal policies or operational procedures, but rather sets ethical boundaries and design criteria that must guide any future implementation of the system.

The content of this document is normative at a conceptual level: it defines both what the system is designed to do and, explicitly, what it must not do.

# 2. Research Context and Ethical Motivation

Host‑level security systems that collect behavioral telemetry and apply intelligent inference mechanisms inevitably interact with sensitive information and human decision‑making processes.

Vulture explicitly acknowledges the ethical risks associated with:

· continuous system observation,
· probabilistic inference about behaviors,
· algorithmic opacity,
· and excessive delegation of judgment to automated systems.

For this reason, ethical considerations are integrated as a structural part of the architecture, not as an add‑on deployed after the fact.

---

# 3. Intended Use of the System

Vulture is designed exclusively for defensive, analytical, and cybersecurity research purposes.

The system adopts a hierarchical architecture that:

· observes behavioral signals,
· correlates multiple independent indicators,
· formulates probabilistic hypotheses,
· and presents explanations anchored in verifiable evidence.

Vulture does not issue definitive verdicts, does not attribute intentionality, and does not execute remediation actions automatically. All results produced by the system are advisory and require human validation.

The system is not intended for surveillance, user profiling, disciplinary control, or autonomous decision‑making.

---

# 4. Interoperability with Established Tools

Vulture is not intended as a replacement for established detection tools based on rules, signatures, or explicit policies.

The system is conceived to operate in parallel with existing solutions such as Falco, audit‑based detectors, or other deterministic mechanisms. Alerts and events produced by these tools may serve as additional signals within the correlation process, without being replaced or invalidated by probabilistic models.

From both an ethical and operational perspective, Vulture recognizes that rule‑based systems offer predictability, reproducibility, and control properties that remain essential in critical environments.

---

# 5. Human Oversight and Decision Authority

Ultimate responsibility for interpreting results and making decisions always rests with human operators.

Vulture is designed to:

· expose uncertainty,
· display underlying evidence,
· and explicitly communicate confidence levels.

The system must not replace human judgment or alter existing decision‑making chains in an operational environment.

---

# 6. Transparency and Explainability

Every analytical output generated by Vulture must be traceable to observable artifacts, such as telemetry events, feature windows, or correlation graphs.

The use of language models is strictly limited to assisting in the generation of explanations. Any generated content must remain anchored to retrieved and logged evidence.

Opaque, unauditable, or non‑reproducible processes are considered incompatible with the project’s principles.

---

# 7. Data Sensitivity and Privacy Considerations

Vulture assumes access to system telemetry under appropriate authorization.

It is acknowledged that such telemetry may contain operationally or contextually sensitive information. Therefore, the project incorporates the following ethical principles:

· minimization of collection,
· limited retention,
· and controlled exposure of data.

Specific privacy‑preserving techniques are considered part of the implementation phase and are outside the scope of this document.

---

# 8. Imprecision in AI Systems

As with any system incorporating statistical or machine‑learning models, Vulture may produce imprecise, incomplete, or incorrect results.

Generated hypotheses represent probabilistic estimates conditioned by available evidence, model assumptions, and the quality of collected telemetry. The presence of a detailed explanation does not necessarily imply the hypothesis is correct.

For this reason, Vulture explicitly exposes confidence levels, uncertainty states, and evidence references, and does not present its results as definitive conclusions.

---

# 9. Explicit Non‑Goals

Vulture is not designed to:

· conduct user surveillance or monitoring,
· automate punitive or coercive actions,
· replace SOC analysts or teams,
· or operate as an autonomous security agent.

Any use outside these boundaries is considered a deviation from the project’s ethical framework.

---
 
# 10. Ethical Review and Project Evolution

As a research project, Vulture’s ethical framework is subject to ongoing review as its architecture, assumptions, and threat model evolve.

This document may be updated to reflect new risks, insights, or constraints identified during the course of the research.
